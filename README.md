style.css file

This file has all of my css code and contains all of the code for the text on my html page
It formats the dates, titles, and buttons on the Calendar page as well as formats all of the lines and opacities of the page.

subCalendar.html file

This file is the file for the second page of my calendar and it used to have the code for the drop-down menu but this was taken out of my calendar and cannot be accessed.

script.js file

This file has old javascript code on it and is no longer used in the website but it used to be used for testing some of the features of the website.

Some of the image files are used in the website and the font files are also used as the custom fonts of my website.
